# Changelog

All notable changes to TeiFS are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and TeiFS follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Until 1.0, minor versions may change
behaviour; the on-disk format is always upgraded automatically.

## Unreleased

First development version: S3 over plain folders (buckets, objects, listings,
multipart uploads, copies, checksums, SigV4 and presigned URLs), a versioned on-disk
format with automatic upgrades, and the `teifs` command. ListObjectVersions and
`versionId=null` work on buckets without versioning, as on AWS.
